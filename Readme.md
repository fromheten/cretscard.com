#Yarr!
This is my port, where I unload booty found around the web-sea. It's built with `nanoc`, but if you wish to clone it you will only need `bundler`. You should be able to view the compiled output if you sail thru port 80 to cretscard.com, but my host may be grumpy and not let you dock. Nah, that won't happen to someone as handsome as you.

#Licence, damnit
For code-things (generally things outside of content/) all code is under the MIT licence. For the human-language content I reserve all rights for myself, until I have figured out what CC licence I want. It's so boring!
