      <h1>Test Post, Please Ignore</h1>
      <p>I’ve been thinking about making a better blog (better than s$#t, that is) for a while. Doing it with nanoc seems like a good way to do it. Static pages and ruby are my two favourite dishes. </p>
      
      <p>Here is short a list of what is going on in my life, and what I am looking forward to/fancy to do list (note that this is just as much a post as it is a test of inline html in md):</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Moving to Berlin on the 2nd of October</li>
      		<ul>
      		<li>Joining <a href="Rug::B">http://www.rug-b.de/</a></li>
      		</ul>
        <li>Learning German, via course in Berlin and continuing with <a href="http://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a></li>
      	<li>Getting good with Sinatra
      	  <ul>
      	    <li>Internalizing DataMapper</li>
      	    <li>Learning and internalizing ActiveRecord</li>
      	    <li>Publishing what I write instead of rm -r it.</li>
      	  </ul>
      	</li>
      	<li>Becoming <em>really</em> good with Rails.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="okey-then-now-what">Okey then, now what?</h2>
      <p>I’ll just publish this, in order to have something to do <em>css magick</em> on.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
