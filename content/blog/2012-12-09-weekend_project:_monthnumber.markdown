I created a small webapp that displays what month it is and what the number of the month is. It's silly, but I do too often forget about that. Yes, I know it's elementary level, but remembering integers is for computers to do, not humans. 

Ask <a href="http://www.monthnumber.com/">monthnumber.com</a> for the site, and it will provide! The source is avaliable <a href="https://github.com/fromheten/Monthnumber">via <kdb>git</kdb></a>.

Cheerios!
