I've been thinking about making a better blog (better than s$#t, that is) for a while. Doing it with nanoc seems like a good way to do it. Static pages and ruby are my two favourite dishes. 

Here is short a list of what is going on in my life, and what I am looking forward to/fancy to do list (note that this is just as much a post as it is a test of inline html in md):

<ul>
  <li>Moving to Berlin on the 2nd of October</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Joining <a href="Rug::B">http://www.rug-b.de/</a></li>
		</ul>
  <li>Learning German, via course in Berlin and continuing with <a href="http://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a></li>
	<li>Getting good with Sinatra
	  <ul>
	    <li>Internalizing DataMapper</li>
	    <li>Learning and internalizing ActiveRecord</li>
	    <li>Publishing what I write instead of rm -r it.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Becoming <em>really</em> good with Rails.</li>
</ul>

##Okey then, now what?
I'll just publish this, in order to have something to do *css magick* on.
