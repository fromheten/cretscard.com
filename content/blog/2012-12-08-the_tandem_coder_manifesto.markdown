When learning a new (human) language it's good to have a tandem partner. That is simply someone who knows the language you want to learn, and wants to learn the language you know. This practice takes place both in cyberspace (via voip) and meatspace (via, well, vo coffee). 

This method is a great tool to learn. Why not apply it to different fields?

##Definition of a tandem coder

* A tandem coder is a person you haven't already befriended
* You meet up once a week at a neutral place (bar, sushi, coffee)
* Each meeting you show each other something you learned, and you teach the other person what you have worked on
* You recklessly [share data](http://datalove.me/)

The focus in this relationship is not what you know, but how eager you are to explore. 

You will feel obligated to learn, otherwise your tandem coder will be disappointed. Your learning and exploration will more than double, since you share the journey. Your creativity will blossom when two minds are smashed together over one problem. 

##And now: the worlds first ever tandem coder personal ad
I am Martin Josefsson, I live in Berlin (Prenzlauer Berg) and work with Rails and other web stuff. My spare time is mostly about programming and computers, but I also enjoy learning German, biking and beers. I also like my [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/). You can find me on twitter [@axhlf](https://twitter.com/axhlf) and I often lurk at [RUG::B](http://rug-b.de/). My email address is available at the <a href="/me/">me page</a>.

If you live in Berlin and for some reason don't know me already, please contact me and well agree on a date to meet. If you are curious about what I am into, don't hesitate to contact me.

##The future
To begin with, you should all place your ads in comments and tweets. I'll get right on creating a web app for tandem coder ads. 

In Twitter and Identica you can use "#tandemcoder #city {information}" to find someone.
