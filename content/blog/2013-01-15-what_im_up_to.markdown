* I am learning Batman.js
* When I've written a few Batman more apps, I'll continiue on writing my book about it. It is intended for beginners. I intend it to be in the spirit of [Hartls book](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book) 
* I'm writing a web app (in Rails & Batman) where programmers and other kinds of people who want to learn stuff can find each other. Think of it as match.com, but instead of romance it's about learning. Read [the Tandem Coder Manifesto](/blog/2012-12-08-the_tandem_coder_manifesto)
* Recording the first episodes of a very interesting podcast. In this podcast, I'm reading interesting articles and essays aloud. The idea is that people shall be able to learn from them even when their eyes are otherwise occupied 
* Attending as many meetups and hackathons as possible. HTML, JS, Ruby, Conjure. All Berlin has to offer

I'm always doing things 27 hours a day. If you are interesting in occupying some of them, [here is some info](/webapp/).
